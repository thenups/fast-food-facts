##Focus
Study correlation between geographic location and how it affects health & wellness.

##Questions
- Does volume of fast food restaurants affect health and wellness in a county?
- Do low income areas have more fast food restaurants?
- Do people with lower income levels live in areas with easily accessible fast food?
- Are people with lower education levels more likely to have a lower income? Does that affect their health?


- Look at (by county in US):
  - Volume of fast-food
  - Disease types
  - Income brackets
  - Education level
