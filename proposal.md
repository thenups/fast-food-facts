## Project Name: Fast Food Facts

### Focus
Study that correlation between geographic location and how it affects health & wellness.

### Questions
- Does volume of fast food restaurants affect health and wellness in a county?
- Do low income areas have more fast food restaurants?
- Are people with lower education levels more likely to have a lower income? Does that affect their health?
- What's the variability of health related issues based on tax bracket?

- Look at (by county in US):
  - Volume of fast-food
  - Disease types and volume
  - Income brackets
  - Education level

### Data Sources
- US Census Data
- Google Places
- CDC Data
- Hospital Data
- Web MD (research)
